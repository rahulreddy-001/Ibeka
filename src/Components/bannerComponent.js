        <div className='desc'>With Cognitive Processor XR™, BRAVIA TVs analyse the content and recreate it the same way humans see and hear in the real world. For example, they understand where humans tend to focus in a picture—like the main character in a movie. They also know that sound should come from above you when it's a jet aircraft and recreate that sound in your living room. The result is your favourite content recreated in a way that's so real you can feel it.</div>
